            Sniper is a great low-level tank that can effectively hunt and kill most tanks in the game. Becomes very toxic at higher levels.

        <strategy>
            You can sometimes utilise your increased FoV and see a sliver of a tank at the edge of your field of view and set up an ambush because of it, other than that though there really isn't much to the tank.

    <section name="Trivia">
        - Machine Gun and Sniper are the only two tanks that, at some point, could upgrade into themselves.

        - The Sniper and its upgradesâ€™ Bullets do not slow down when traveling through obstacles (enemy Bullets, Polygons), which may be helpful for farming. From another side, a very high Bullet Speed might be the reason the Bullet will fail to output the max amount of damage to small and strong Polygons like the Pentagon.
        
        - A Sniper, alongside a Machine Gun, with maxed out reload and movement speed at level 15 is the fastest tank in the game outside of Sandbox.
        
        - The Sniper branch of the Class tree is the largest of the Tier 2 branches.
        
        - A Sniper can become one of 14 distinct Tier 4 Classes, as well as an additional 4 Tier 3 Classes.
        
        - It also has three other Tier 4 Classes that can be accessed without using Sniper. These are the Battleship, Gunner Trapper, and Streamliner.
