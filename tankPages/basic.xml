            Basic tank is the first tank you spawn in, there's not much to the tank other than it being a decent focused dps option.

    <section name="Trivia">

            - The Tank is the only Tier 1 tank in the game.

            - The Tank is one of two Classes that has an upgrade directly branching from it that is two tiers higher than itself, the Smasher (Tier 3). The other tank with this quality is the Machine Gun, branching to the Sprayer (Tier 4).
           
            - This Tank, along with the Twin, Triplet, Triple Shot, Quad Tank and Octo Tank, were the first tanks ever added to the game (before its public release). 

            - At level 45, 6 of this tank's bullets deal as much damage as the Destroyer Branch's. It can kill a level 45 tank in 2 shots if fully upgraded in Bullet Speed, Penetration and Damage.
