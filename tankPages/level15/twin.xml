            There's nothing you can really do as twin to gain any obvious advantage with twin although stacking your bullets is an option to make each volley more punishing.

    <section name="Trivia">
        - Sometimes when ignoring its Level 30 upgrades, when the player reached Level 45, no upgrades would appear, and they would be stuck as a Twin. This was fixed shortly after.
            
        - The Twin is the smallest Tier 2 branch, having only 7 total Tier 4 tanks branch from it and its Upgrade choices.
        
        - The base shooting speed for the Twin and the Machine Gun are very similar, if not, the same.
        
        - When shooting, you may shoot 2 bullets and once by clicking twice. By clicking twice to shoot, you get a new pattern of shots.
