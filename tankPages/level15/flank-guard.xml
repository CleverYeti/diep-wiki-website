            Flankguard is a decent level 15 tank that trades defense for offense in the form of reduced recoil. It's a good tank overall with no real notable weaknesses.

            Due to not having any recoil flank guard is less reliant on positioning skills and aim - having a much easier time just purely building up a bullet wall, bomb rushing tanks and getting kills that way.
