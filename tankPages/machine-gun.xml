        - The initial community nicknamed the this tank "Cone Gun" due to the Machine Gun having a cone-like cannon.
        
        - Sometimes, when you upgrade from Tank to Machine Gun (With Auto Fire on), 2 bullets will fire at the same time, with the exact opposite spread.
        
        - A Machine Gun, alongside a Sniper, with maxed out reload and movement speed at level 15 is the fastest tank in the game outside of Sandbox.
        
        - Machine Gun and Sniper are the only two tanks that, at some point, could upgrade into themselves.
