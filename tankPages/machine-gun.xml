            Machinegun doesn't really have that many gimmicks but you can use it's recoil to run away and escape effectively any tank in the game. Do note though that it's raw bullet defense leaves much to be desired though because of its semi-random bullet pattern.

    <section name="Trivia">
        - The initial community nicknamed the this tank "Cone Gun" due to the Machine Gun having a cone-like cannon.
        
        - Sometimes, when you upgrade from Tank to Machine Gun (With Auto Fire on), 2 bullets will fire at the same time, with the exact opposite spread.
        
        - A Machine Gun, alongside a Sniper, with maxed out reload and movement speed at level 15 is the fastest tank in the game outside of Sandbox.
        
        - Machine Gun and Sniper are the only two tanks that, at some point, could upgrade into themselves.
