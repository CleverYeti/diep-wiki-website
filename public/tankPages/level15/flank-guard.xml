        - The Flank Guard has the 2nd smallest tier 2 branch out of the 4, with 8 possible level 45 upgrades.
        - The achievement for upgrading to Flank Guard is "Ain't no one sneaking up on ME".
        - Flank Guard was the ninth tank to be added to the game, after Machine Gun; with its ID being '8'.
        - In one of the oldest versions, the barrels of the Flank Guard would fire at alternating times. People created spin bots to abuse this mechanic, which started the first ever form of flip fire.
