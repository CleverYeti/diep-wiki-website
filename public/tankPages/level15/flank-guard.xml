    <section name="Strategy">
        - Avoid drone tanks, high frontal DPS tanks and good Sniper players.

        - Attack Trappers, bullet spammers and rammers.

        - Flank Guard doesn't have recoil while attacking, use this to rush players while being slowed.

        - Flank Guard cant defend well due to this lack of movement speed, so using both barrels to your advantage is important.

        - Position yourself well to aim with both barrels similtainiously but also know what position isn't and try to just escape.

    <section name="Trivia">
        - In one of the oldest versions, the barrels of the Flank Guard would fire at alternating times. People created spin bots to abuse this mechanic, which started the first ever form of flip fire.
        
        - Flank Guard only has two unique Tier 4 upgrades that only it can upgrade to, being Booster and Fighter. All other Tier 4 tanks are upgradable from other Tier 2 tanks.

        - Flank Guard’s back barrel is shorter than its main barrel, but they both have the same amount of penetration, damage, reload, and recoil.
