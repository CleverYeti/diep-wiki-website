    <section name="Twin Info">
        Twin tank is a tier 2 tank that can be selected upon reaching level 15, and at tier 3, can be upgraded into "Triple Shot", "Quad Tank" or "Twin Flank". It features 2 barrels side by side at the front of the tank body, doubling its firepower. The bullet damage is however nerfed compared to Basic Tank. It is a strong tank to use up to level 45 as it is often a much better option than the level 30 upgrades.
