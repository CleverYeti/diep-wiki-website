    <section name="Strategy">
        - Avoid Destroyer classes, good drone players and higher frontal DPS tanks.

        - Attack lower DPS tanks, Snipers, Trappers, rammers and bullet spammers.

        - Jittering your cursor slightly to where you're aiming spreads the bullets more, making them harder to dodge.

        - Use your recoil to boost towards tanks to attack and away from attacking tanks as Movement Speed is necessary, be careful when doing this as they are vulnerable to the defender and other attackers.

    <section name="Trivia">
        - During the pre release no other upgrade choices, and they would automatically upgrade from the basic Tank into a Twin at Level 15.

        - In one of the oldest versions, Twin used to upgrade directly into "Triplet" at level 30, however this was changed due to it being overpowered, with Triple Shot taking its place. This makes the Twin the only tank to have one of its Upgrades changed to an Upgrade of its Upgrade.

        - It used to have only one firing pattern, in which the Cannons shoot alternatively. You can now manipulate how the barrels fire by shooting at random intervals.

        - The Twin class has the smallest tier 2 branch out of the 4, with only 7 possible level 45 upgrades.
