    <section name="Strategy">
        - Avoid drone tanks, rammers and high frontal DPS tanks.

        - Attack low health tanks, Destroyer classes and some bullet spammers.

        - Utilising the larger Field of View to their advantage to keep players in the top or bottom of their screen as other players have the least amount of time to react to Sniper's fast bullets.
        
        - Keep your distance between players as the low rate of fire isn't good for close quarters, and the high bullet speed can hit from afar.

        - Only shoot bullets that are needed, bullets fired can attract attention reducing its stealthiness.
        
        - A swarm of Crashers is able to drain the health and stop the regen of Sniper due to Sniper's low rate of fire, stay at the edge and shoot inwards to kill distracted players farming pentagons.
