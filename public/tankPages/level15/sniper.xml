    <section name="Sniper Info">
        Sniper is a tier 2 tank that can be selected upon reaching level 15, and at tier 3, can be upgraded into "Assassin", "Overseer", "Hunter" or "Trapper". It features 1 barrel, slightly longer than Basic Tank's, at the front of the tank body. The base speed of the tank's bullet is increased, while the reload is reduced. The main gimmick surrounding Sniper is that its 'Field Of View' (FOV) is increased, so it can see a further distance than most tanks.

        - Sniper's increased FOV means it can hide just outside the FOV of some other tanks while still keeping them visible. Utilising this is useful for ambushing/catching your opponent off guard.
