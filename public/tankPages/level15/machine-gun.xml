    <section name="Strategy">
        - Avoid Snipers, good drone players and very high frontal DPS tanks.

        - Attack lower frontal DPS tanks, bullet spammers, Trappers and rammers.

        - Jittering your cursor slightly to where you're aiming spreads the bullets more, making them harder to dodge.

        - Use your recoil to boost towards tanks to attack and away from attacking tanks as Movement Speed is necessary, be careful when doing this as they are vulnerable to the defender and other attackers.
