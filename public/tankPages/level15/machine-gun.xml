    <section name="Machine Gun Info">
        Machine Gun is a tier 2 tank that can be selected upon reaching level 15, and at tier 3, can be upgraded into "Destroyer" or "Gunner". At level 45 it can upgrade straight into "Sprayer". It features 1 trapezoid barrel  at the front of the tank body. The bullet damage of Machine Gun is nerfed compared to Basic Tank, but is stronger than twin's bullets. It has a high reload increase and a large spread. Much like the Twin, it is a strong tank to use up to level 45.

    <section name="Strategy">
        - The high reload and spread of this tank is useful for overwhelming opponents with lower reload. By jittering your cursor (or shoooting wheel in mobile) slightly in front of the tank you can further increase the spread, minimising your opponents options for escape.
        - The high reload also serves as good recoil, allowing this class to be used as a rammer.
