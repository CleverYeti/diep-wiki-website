        <strategy>
            Strong Against: Low upgraded tanks, bullet-shooting tanks with lower frontal DPS if the player is maxed out in bullet power and Reload.
            
            Weak Against: Bullet Spammers, Overlords, highly upgraded tanks, high-level tanks, Bosses, Sniper tanks if caught off guard.
            
            While playing teams modes, players should stay close to the Base and take out Polygons nearby when they are at a lower level. If the enemy team’s players are taking up most of the Leaderboard and/or are spawn-camping the player’s team, consider going to a different area of the spawn camp. Again, players should upgrade Max Health or Movement Speed.
            
            Players should stay away from others as much as possible in non-team game modes. Try to refrain from fighting others.
            
            Do not underestimate the Tank. Although it's a Tier 1 tank, it does not mean it can't kill you. A skilled Tank can easily kill other classes.
            
            Bullet spammers can easily overwhelm the tank if they have enough Bullet Penetration because the Tank has only one cannon. If a player’s strategy is to wander around getting points mainly by killing all the Tanks they see, becoming a Triplet or a Sprayer could help them.

            An Overlord could flank a basic tank; however, it is still appropriate to attack it from the front since the Tank doesn't have enough reload to destroy them all. But be careful, because a Tank with almost and/or fully maxed out Movement Speed may easily run away from them.
            
            Beware of surprise rammers; players occasionally level up but choose to stay as a tank and can quickly upgrade and surprise their opponent. The player may be able to spot one if the enemy Tank is trying to get too close to them. When this happens, the player must kill them as quickly as possible.
