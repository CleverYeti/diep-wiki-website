        Smasher is a tier 3 tank that can be selected upon reaching level 30 with "Basic Tank", and at tier 4, can be upgraded into "Landmine", "Auto Smasher", and "Spike". It has no barrels but instead a spinning black hexagonal shell. This tank can only deal damage by ramming other shapes and tanks.

    <section name="Strategy">
        - Smasher is best used as soon as you upgrade into it at level 30 as it is at its smallest, meaning it will be faster. You can then utilise this to bomb unsuspecting players.
