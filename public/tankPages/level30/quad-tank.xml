    <section name="Quad Tank Info">
        Quad Tank is a tier 3 tank that can be selected upon reaching level 30 using "Twin" or "Flank Guard", and at level 45, can be upgraded into "Octo Tank" or "Auto 5". It features 4 barrels each perpendicular to each other. This tank is often skipped when upgrading due to it having less focused power in one direction than Twin, however when pressing C + E (auto spin and auto fire), it upgrades very fast as it covers a wide area of shapes.
