    <section name="Strategy">
        - While in general most people would avoid upgrading to this tank; it remains viable to use with lower bullet speeds, as you can create bullet walls by moving your cursor around in front of your tank.
        - Due to the high recoil of this tank, it makes for a very good unsuspecting rammer class.
