    <section name="Twin Flank info">
        Twin Flank is a tier 3 tank that can be selected upon reaching level 30 using "Twin" or "Flank Guard", and at level 45, can be upgraded into "Triple Twin" or "Battleship". It features 4 barrels; 2 side by side at the front of the tank, and 2 side by side at the back. As the name suggests, it is a Twin and Flank Guard combo. This tank is often skipped when upgrading due to it being vulnerable on the sides and that it lacks any recoil, making it difficult to escape tricky situations quickly like you would be able to with Twin.
