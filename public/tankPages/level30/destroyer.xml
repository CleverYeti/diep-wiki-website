    <section name="Destroyer Info">
        Destroyer is a tier 3 tank that can be selected upon reaching level 30 using "Machine Gun", and at level 45, can be upgraded into "Hybrid", "Annihilator", "Skimmer", "Rocketeer" and "Glider". It features 1 cannon (wide barrel) at the front of the tank. This tank shoots large bullet, (roughly the size of a level 1 tank, when at level 30). It can 1 shot any tank that has no health or body upgrades. The cannon also has very large recoil making this tank a popular rammer option.

    <section name="Strategy">
        - Due to the high recoil, this tank is great for ambushing; shoot a bullet in the opposite direction of the player you want to attack to get close to them, then shot another bullet to 1 shot them
                o or alternatively, ram them if you have rammer points.

    <section name="Trivia">
        - In older versions, Destroyer was able to upgrade into itself at level 45. This however had no added benefits.

        - The achievement for upgrading to Destroyer is "BOOM you're dead".
