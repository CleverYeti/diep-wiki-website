    <section name="Assassin info">
        Assassin is a tier 3 tank that can be selected upon reaching level 30 using "Sniper", and at level 45, can be upgraded into "Ranger" or "Stalker". It features 1 barrel, slightly longer than the Sniper barrel. This tank has further reduced reload compared to Sniper, and further increased bullet speed and penetration, and FOV. This tank is often skipped due to its lower reload.
